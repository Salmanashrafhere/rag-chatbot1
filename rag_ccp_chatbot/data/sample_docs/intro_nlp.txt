Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence concerned with enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
Key tasks include tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, text classification, and question answering.
This project uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): retrieve relevant knowledge from documents, then generate answers conditioned on that context.
